Yahoo-Weather-Loading-Indicator
===============================
Have you unpack the Yahoo weather app? It contains hundreds of images for animating the loading indicator.

This project clones the Yahoo weather app's loading indicator with no image at all, everything is drawing using Quartz and everything can be customised, all you need is add 'Loading Indicator' (Dir) to your project and start to use RSLoadingIndicator.

Open sample to see lot more.
